                            <em>Detailled answer:</em>
                            We receive only the data mandatory to run a targeting operation:
                            the list of users and usergroups in your organization. Once the private messages have been sent,
                            we forget everything! In fact, we do not even have a database ðŸ˜®

                            <a href="#avoid-association">Can I make sure someone will be matched or not matched with someone else?</a>
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            No, the association is purely random so you cannot do that with our application.
                            An alternative could be to launch 2 targeting operations with two groups of people.

                            <a href="#new-participant">Can I add a new participant once messages have been sent?</a>
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            No, you can't. However, you can still start a new game. We advice you to add a note in the
                            message mentioning that this new draw cancel and replace the old one.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="big-team">
                        <h2>
                            <a href="#big-team">Will the app work with team larger than 500 people?</a>
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            There is a 2 things to understand here. The first step in our application is to retrieve
                            all the users on your Slack workspace / Discord server - yes we retrieve all the users to allow
                            you to select the ones that will participate in your game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When your team is really big, Slack or Discord APIs can fail to send us all the users in a
                            reasonable duration. That means you will no be able to start a targeting operation. A
                            possible workaround would be to create a new Slack workspace / Discord server with only the
                            participants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second step is to dispatch a private message to all the selected users. Even if you started
                            a targeting operation with a lot of participants, the application will send all the messages progressively.
                            So there should not be any problem here.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="invalid-user">
                        <h2>
                            <a href="#invalid-user">Why did someone receive <code>@invalid-user</code> as their target?</a>
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            This is due to a known bug of the Discord Android application. The workaround is to open the
                            conversation on the Discord desktop app (for Windows, MacOS or Linux) or on the website.
                        </p>
